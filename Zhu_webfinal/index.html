        My name is Tiffany Zhu and I am currently a student at City College of San Francicso while majoring in Graphic Design. I took VMD 105 because I wanted to furthur my skills with digital art and design. I have a strong passion in art and design, so taking VMD 105 helps me a lot since I am able to build most of the skills from Photoshop to html and css. In this website, I am showcasing my past work and how much I put my time and effort with passion into creating my pieces.
