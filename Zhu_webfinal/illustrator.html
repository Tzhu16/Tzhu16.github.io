        I always wanted to try creating a logo since this is my first time experimenting vector based program. The theme is wedding, meaning I want to create a wedding theme logo with a fairy bride girl, who grants wishes to the couples marriage of their life time. What I like about this work is that I can practice with logo design. As I get used to vector based program, I could create a logo for cilents. VMD 105 helped me a lot with vector based program since I know what I can do with vectors.
