        The concept is about a boy falling in love at first sight, which is the pun for "falling" and "in love." This animation project is one of the most time consuming and least favorite project since I had a difficult time rendering and making the arms and legs in motion. I was trying my best to make a few angle shots, but at the end, I tried. I appreciate how much effort I put into. Possibly I could work with animaiton projects and character designs.
