        San Francisco: the best and the worst
        </h1>
        
        <h2>
        The best neighborhood is Sunset district
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            The environment is <em>quiet</em>, housings are better, and more convenient busing  
        </p>
        
        <h2>
        The worst neighborhood is Tenderloin 
        </h2>
        
        <p>
         There are too much sketchy people, smells horrific, and too much <strong>crimes</strong>
